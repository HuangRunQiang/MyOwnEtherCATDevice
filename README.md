# Making my own EtherCAT device

This repository contains software, pcb shematics and layouts, reference documentation etc
that I used during my creation of my own EtherCAT device.

This job is documented in a series of Youtube videos, from my first attempts to understand
how EtherCAT works, to making my own pcb, program it and testing it in LinuxCNC.

## My own EtherCat 4. My PCB and details

In this video it starts to be inteeresting. I have got the pcb and I try to make it work.
Now I finally make documentation available, see [a link](Pcb-1-lan9252/README.md).
